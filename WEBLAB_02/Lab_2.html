		<td>It would be a very easy transition to La Jolla and i love the culture down near Pacific Beach. UCSD is a very high achieving school and would look very good on a job apllication. They have a very good mdical program, which is a program I am interested in.</td>

		<td>UCSB is another amazing school that stays in this beautiful weather. I also enjoy the fact that it is in northern California becuase I have lived and explored all of southern California. I would enjoy the coast, while also being closer to the snow covered mountains.</td>

		<td><h4>Los Angeles, CA 90095</h4></td>
		<td>UCLA is nearly impossible to get into. It is one of the most well know schools in the world. UCLA is also in the heart if L.A. I have little experience in big cities, so this would be fun to try and maybe see if would want to live in a citey later in life.</td>

		<td><h4>Irvine, CA 92697</h4></td>
		<td>UCI is also near a big city. It satys in California's amazing weather and is close to mountains as well as coast. I prefer western culture and I feel it would be prominent at UCI. It would also be an easy transition from home.</td>
